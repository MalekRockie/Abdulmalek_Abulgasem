    Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control over the
    way that a page is displayed. It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means
    of marking up the structure of a document not as a way of determining its presentation.
    Formatting text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from formatting text to appear
    in a printed document.
    This
    is
    Cool.
